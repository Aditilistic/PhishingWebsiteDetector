# PhishingWebsiteDetector
## Introduction
Phishing attacks are the most common cyber-attacks nowadays. It’s the user that makes a device vulnerable to attacks. Social engineering is more effective than any hacking method because it relies on human error rather than finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in computer systems. ​

Our approach towards solving this problem is by providing humans with tools to help them make better decisions by employing systems that can recognize patterns which would be too complex for humans to identify.​

An ML model trained on over 10,000+ samples gathers data about the URL before the user clicks it and makes predictions about the reliability of the URL and tells whether it is a phishing site or not.​

Also, our website provides a list of URLs that our model has identified to be phishing sites, it lists phishing attacks that have been reported around the world, and it provides a search bar for the user to enter a suspicious URL and run it through the model to find out whether it could be a phishing site or not.​
